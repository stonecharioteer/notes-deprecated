Interview Preparation
=======================


This section contains my notes that are solely for interview preparation. This
targets FAANG-style leetcode-farming, and my daily progress.

I am not going to talk about whether or not this interview process works. I just want to
be able to ace any interview I go to.

Preparation Roadmap
---------------------

I am taking this interview preparation timeline from the first chapter of :ref:`elements-of-programming-interviews`,
and I'm tuning it with things I've found in :ref:`ctci`.

Your mileage may vary.

Each of these sections has a *pre-read*, a *daily-activity*, and
a *review*, which usually involves *Leetcode* problems.

.. warning::

    This document is still a WIP, so I will be editing this as I go along.


.. tab:: Three Months

    This is the plan I use, and I will be focussing on this the most.

.. tab:: Six Months

    This is the plan I recommend following, if you haven't interviewed in over a year.

.. tab:: One Year

    This is the "I don't hate my job but would like a backup" plan. I don't recommend this
    unless you have nothing better to do.



Big-O
----------

The best introduction to Big-O I have found so far is in :ref:`common-sense-guide`.
My :ref:`notes on Big-O from it <common-sense-guide-big-o>` will be the section to refresh
here. This should take 2 days. Do all the exercises in the book.

.. tab:: Three Months

    2 Days

    Day 1: Read :ref:`common-sense-guide-big-o`

    Day 2: Read :ref:`ctci-big-o`

    Do all the exercises in both books. :ref:`common-sense-guide`'s exercises will
    not take more than 20 minutes.  I need to check how long :ref:`ctci` will
    take.

Data Structures
-----------------

.. tab:: Three Months

    Day 3: Arrays and Strings

    Day 4: Linked Lists

    Day 5: Stacks

    Day 6: Queues

    Day 7: Trees

    Day 8: Graphs

    Day 9: Heaps

    Day 10: Hash Tables

    Day 11: Review

    Day 12: Review

    .. note::

        At the end of this, you'd be at day 12, so you should have started
        Leetcode by now. Focus on topics.  As you go through the above topics,
        churn out solutions to leetcode problems in those topics. Just read the
        questions and try to write answers. You'll get back to this later.
