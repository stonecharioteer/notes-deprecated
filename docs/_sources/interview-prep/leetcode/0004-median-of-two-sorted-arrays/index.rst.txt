=========================================
HARD-ðŸ˜­ 0004. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
=========================================

-------------------------
Problem Statement
-------------------------

`Leetcode Link <https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/>`_

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return
the median of the two sorted arrays.

Constraints
================

.. code-block:: javascript

    nums1.length == m
    nums2.length == n
    0 <= m <= 1000
    0 <= n <= 1000
    1 <= m + n <= 2000
    -106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106

Follow up: The overall run time complexity should be :math:`O(log (m+n))`.


.. tip::

    Remember that the *median* of a list is *that* item
    that divides the list into two equal halves, by population.


.. tip::

    This problem uses principles I've come across when learning the
    :ref:`merge-sort` algorithm.
    It should help to re-read that section before trying to solve this problem.

Solution
---------------------

This is a good explanation targeting this problem:
`Binary Search - Median of Two Sorted Arrays <https://youtu.be/LPFhl65R7ww>`_.

1. Partition the two arrays into two other arrays which are of equal halves.
2. Ensure that every element on the left side is less than or equal to every
   element on the right side.
