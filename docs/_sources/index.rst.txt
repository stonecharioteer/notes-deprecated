Stonecharioteer's Notes
=========================

Hi there! This site contains my personal notes on different topics.
If you'd like to read more organized posts, I'd recommend
`visiting my blog. <https://stonecharioteer.com/>`_


.. warning::

   While I do maintain copious notes on various topics, this is not a blog, and neither
   is it meant for public reading. I use this site mostly to revise my notes and search through
   them when I'm on a phone or a tablet.

   If you'd like to use the interview prep roadmap, feel free, but note that it is a roadmap
   that works for me (at least I'd like to assume so, but I'll update this if I get the job
   I'm looking for), and might not work for you.

While I cover notes on several topics, you'll be more interested in what I'm currently
working on.
