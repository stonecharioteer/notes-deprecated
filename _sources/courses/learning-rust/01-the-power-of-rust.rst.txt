The Power of Rust
==============================

----------------
Hello, Rust
----------------

Immutable by default
========================

Declare variables using: `let x = 10;`

To *enable* mutability, use: `var mut x = 10;`

Uninitialized variables are forbidden
=========================================


Functions in Rust look like this:

.. code:: rust

    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }


.. code:: rust

    fn main() {
        let a = 1;
        let b = 2;
        println!("{} + {} = {}", a, b, a+b);
    }

`println!` is a *macro*, what that means is that the compiler does some
predetermination ahead of time for the types that are passed to it each time.

Rust has *a strong, static type system*.
==================================================

Strongly typed means that types are not automatically cast from one to another.

Static means that the types are known at compile time.
