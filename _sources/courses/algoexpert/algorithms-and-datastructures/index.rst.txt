Algorithms and Data Structures
=======================================

.. note::

    This section outlines my thoughts on the video material in the algoexpert course.

---------------------------
Videos
---------------------------


Video 1 - Introduction
==========================

This walks us through *why* algorithms and data structures are needed in programming interviews and how
this course attempts to teach them.

Video 2 - What are Data Structures?
=========================================

This video walks through what data structures are and why we need them.

> Coding is just manipulating data.

Knowing the right data structure helps us use the right method to solve a problem.

Video 3 - Complexity Analysis
==============================

Time complexity and space complexity

Time complexity analyses how an algorithm scales with the inputs it gets.

Space Complexity describes how much memory your algorithm takes with the input it gets.


Video 4 - Memory
====================

This video walks us through how computer memory works.

> Imagine [memory] as a canvas that is bounded and divided into slots.

Memory is finite.

    Look up ``Endianness.``

Video 5 - Big O Notation
==========================


Video 9 - Hash Tables
=========================
